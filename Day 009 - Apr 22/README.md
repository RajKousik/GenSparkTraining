# Pharmacy Management

## Objective:
Develop a console-based pharmacy management system to automate the operations of managing drug inventory, processing prescriptions, and conducting sales transactions in a pharmacy.

## Functional Requirements:

1. Drug Inventory Management:
   - Maintain a comprehensive inventory of drugs, including details such as drug name, brand, dosage form, strength, quantity in stock, expiry date, and price.			
   - Allow staff to add new drug entries, update existing ones, and remove expired or out-of-stock medications.

2. Prescription Processing:
   - Enable pharmacists to process prescriptions by entering patient details, doctor’s name, prescribed drugs, dosages, and duration.
   - Check the availability of prescribed drugs and alert the pharmacist if a drug is nearing low stock levels or is out of stock.

3. Sales Transactions:
   - Process sales transactions for both prescription and over-the-counter drugs.
   - Calculate total costs, apply  and generate sales receipts.
  

## Non-Functional Requirements:

1. User Interface:
   - Develop a user-friendly console interface with clear menus and prompts to ensure ease of use for pharmacy staff.

2. Efficiency:
   - The system should process transactions quickly and accurately, even during peak hours.

3. Reliability:
   - Ensure high reliability and uptime, especially during business hours, to avoid disruptions in pharmacy operations.

4. Security:
   - Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive patient data and comply with healthcare regulations such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act).

5. Scalability:
   - Design the system to easily handle increases in drug inventory, customer traffic, and transaction volume without significant performance degradation.

## Optional Enhancements:

1. Drug Interaction Alerts:
   - Implement a feature to alert pharmacists about potential drug interactions based on the patient’s current medications.

2. Loyalty Programs:
   - Integrate a loyalty program to reward frequent buyers with discounts or special offers.
