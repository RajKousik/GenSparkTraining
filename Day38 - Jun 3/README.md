# HTML Assessment

This project consists of creating three HTML files: a star SVG, a resume, and a replica of a mark sheet. Each file serves a different purpose and helps to demonstrate various aspects of HTML.

### Star SVG

This HTML file will create a star using SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). SVG is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. This exercise will help you understand how to create shapes using SVG in HTML.

### Resume

This HTML file will be a replica of a resume. It will include sections such as contact information, skills, education, and work experience. This exercise will help you understand how to structure content in HTML and how to use various tags to create a well-structured document.

### Mark sheet Replica

This HTML file will be a replica of a mark sheet. It will include sections such as student details and marks obtained in various subjects. This exercise will help you understand how to create tables in HTML and how to structure complex data.
